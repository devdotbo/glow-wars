## Usage Tips:
- Add "highly detailed", "4K", "concept art", or "digital art" for higher quality
- Include artist names like "by Beeple" or "by Simon St√•lenhag" for specific styles
- Use negative prompts to exclude unwanted elements (e.g., "-realistic -photo -3D")
- For Midjourney: Add "--ar 16:9" for widescreen or "--ar 1:1" for square formats
- For DALL-E: Be more descriptive and specific
- For Stable Diffusion: Use style LoRAs for consistent aesthetic
