## Detailed Progress

### Task 1: Core Database Schema & Player Management

**Status**: Completed  
**Completed**: 2025-01-19T23:07:00Z  
**Actual Tokens Used**: ~3.5k

#### Deliverables Completed:

- [x] Complete database schema with players, games, and gamePlayers tables
- [x] Player CRUD operations (createPlayer, getPlayer, listPlayers)
- [x] Integration tests using real Convex backend

#### Test Results (6/6 passing):

- [x] Create player with valid data
- [x] Retrieve player by ID
- [x] List all players
- [x] Validate hex color format (#RRGGBB)
- [x] Handle duplicate names
- [x] Handle concurrent player creation

#### Implementation Notes:

- Used new Convex function syntax with explicit validators
- Added indexes for efficient queries (by_name on players table)
- Implemented hex color validation with regex pattern
- Set up vitest with real Convex backend testing (no mocks)
- Created testingFunctions.clearAll for test isolation
- Tests run sequentially (maxWorkers: 1) to avoid conflicts

#### Files Created:

- `convex/players.ts` - Player management functions
- `convex/players.test.ts` - Integration tests
- `convex/testingFunctions.ts` - Test utilities
- `vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration

#### Files Modified:

- `convex/schema.ts` - Added Glow Wars tables
- `package.json` - Added test dependencies and script

### Task 2: Game Session Management

**Status**: Completed  
**Completed**: 2025-01-20T07:52:50Z  
**Actual Tokens Used**: ~9k

#### Deliverables Completed:

- [x] Game creation with configuration (name, maxPlayers, mapType)
- [x] Player joining/leaving mechanics with validation
- [x] Game state transitions (waiting -> active)
- [x] Switched from real backend testing to convex-test mock system

#### Test Results (6/6 passing):

- [x] Create game with valid configuration
- [x] Join game as player (with auto-join for creator)
- [x] Prevent joining full games
- [x] Start game with minimum players (2)
- [x] Handle player leaving game (with creator cleanup)
- [x] List available games with player counts

#### Implementation Notes:

- Migrated entire test suite to use convex-test mock system
- Added pnpm as the required package manager (updated CLAUDE.md)
- Installed @edge-runtime/vm for vitest edge-runtime environment
- Updated schema to include createdBy and joinedAt fields
- Implemented all game session CRUD operations
- Added import.meta.glob pattern for module loading in tests
- Changed testingFunctions to internalMutation
- Updated technical docs to reflect mock-based testing approach

#### Technical Decisions:

- Auto-join creator when creating a game
- Delete game if creator leaves while in waiting state
- Minimum 2 players required to start a game
- Random position generation for joining players
- Initial glow radius set to 50 for all players

#### Files Created:

- `convex/games.ts` - Game session management functions
- `convex/games.test.ts` - Integration tests
- `convex/setupTests.ts` - Test setup helper (can be removed)

#### Files Modified:

- `convex/schema.ts` - Added createdBy and joinedAt fields
- `convex/players.test.ts` - Migrated to convex-test
- `convex/testingFunctions.ts` - Changed to internalMutation
- `vitest.config.ts` - Configured for edge-runtime
- `package.json` - Added @edge-runtime/vm
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added pnpm requirement
- `docs/glow-wars-technical-implementation.md` - Updated testing approach

### Task 3: Real-time Position Updates & Territory System

**Status**: Completed  
**Completed**: 2025-01-20T08:20:00Z  
**Actual Tokens Used**: ~7k

#### Deliverables Completed:

- [x] Real-time position update system with validation
- [x] Territory painting mechanism (automatic on movement)
- [x] Territory ownership calculation and statistics
- [x] Grid-based territory system (100x100 cells)

#### Test Results (12/12 passing):

- [x] Update player position with valid coordinates
- [x] Validate position boundaries (0-1000 range)
- [x] Prevent position updates for inactive games
- [x] Prevent position updates for dead players
- [x] Handle concurrent position updates
- [x] Stream all player positions in game
- [x] Paint territory at player position
- [x] Overwrite existing territory
- [x] Calculate territory ownership percentages
- [x] Automatically paint territory when position updates
- [x] Handle concurrent territory painting
- [x] Validate grid boundaries

#### Implementation Notes:

- Map size: 1000x1000 units with 10x10 grid cells (100x100 total cells)
- Position updates automatically paint territory at player location
- Territory painting uses helper function pattern (Convex best practice)
- Last painter wins for territory ownership
- Added positions table for position history tracking
- Added territory table with grid-based ownership
- Comprehensive indexes for efficient queries

#### Technical Decisions:

- Used helper function pattern to avoid direct function calls
- Territory painting is automatic when position updates
- Grid system allows efficient territory queries
- Position history preserved for potential replay features

#### Files Created:

- `convex/positions.ts` - Position management functions
- `convex/positions.test.ts` - Position system tests
- `convex/territory.ts` - Territory painting functions
- `convex/territory.test.ts` - Territory system tests

#### Files Modified:

- `convex/schema.ts` - Added positions and territory tables
