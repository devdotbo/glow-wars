- Territory ownership provides glow replenishment (0.1 per owned cell)
- Min/max glow radius: 10-100 units
- Modified territory painting to paint multiple cells based on glow radius

#### Technical Decisions:

- Glow decay runs automatically for all active games
- Boost cost is fixed at 5 glow units (planned for speed multiplier in future)
- Larger glow radius creates circular painting pattern
- Territory tests updated to accommodate multi-cell painting behavior

#### Files Created:

- Cron job updates all sparks every 1 second
- Test had to position players away from sparks to avoid random flee states

#### Technical Decisions:

- Used helper functions to enable both direct calls and cron execution

- Wander uses random direction changes
- Flee moves directly away from nearest player
- Entity health system ready for damage mechanics

#### Files Created:

- Additional cron job runs every 500ms for all active games
- Added consumeGlow function to glow.ts for testing

#### Technical Decisions:

- Simple Euclidean distance for collision detection
- Automatic collision checks integrated with position updates
- Bounce physics pushes players apart along collision vector

- Movement speed: 3 units/update (faster than sparks)
- Health: 20 (more durable than sparks)
- Damage: 10 glow on contact with 10 unit contact distance
- Three behavioral states: patrol, hunt, return
- Efficiently finds dark areas using sampled grid search
- Reuses existing aiEntities infrastructure

#### Technical Decisions:

- Sample every 10th grid cell for performance when finding dark areas
- Creepers actively flee painted territory to maintain lore consistency
- Cannot be consumed like sparks (only damaged in future features)
- Hunt behavior only activates for players in darkness
- Uses helper pattern for cron job compatibility

#### Files Created:

- `convex/ai/creepers.ts` - Shadow Creeper AI logic
- `convex/creepers.test.ts` - Integration tests

#### Files Modified:
