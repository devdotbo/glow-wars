## Detailed Progress

### Task 1: Core Database Schema & Player Management

**Status**: Completed  
**Completed**: 2025-01-19T23:07:00Z  
**Actual Tokens Used**: ~3.5k

#### Deliverables Completed:

- [x] Complete database schema with players, games, and gamePlayers tables
- [x] Player CRUD operations (createPlayer, getPlayer, listPlayers)
- [x] Integration tests using real Convex backend

#### Test Results (6/6 passing):

- [x] Create player with valid data
- [x] Retrieve player by ID
- [x] List all players
- [x] Validate hex color format (#RRGGBB)
- [x] Handle duplicate names
- [x] Handle concurrent player creation

#### Implementation Notes:

- Used new Convex function syntax with explicit validators
- Added indexes for efficient queries (by_name on players table)
- Implemented hex color validation with regex pattern
- Set up vitest with real Convex backend testing (no mocks)
- Created testingFunctions.clearAll for test isolation
- Tests run sequentially (maxWorkers: 1) to avoid conflicts

#### Files Created:

- `convex/players.ts` - Player management functions
- `convex/players.test.ts` - Integration tests
- `convex/testingFunctions.ts` - Test utilities
- `vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration

#### Files Modified:

- `convex/schema.ts` - Added Glow Wars tables
- `package.json` - Added test dependencies and script
