# Architecture Simplification Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. E2E Test Fixes
- Fixed game ID mismatch in MenuUI (8-char slice for data-game-id)
- Updated listAvailableGames to filter out full games
- Added React Query refresh interval for real-time updates

### 2. Development Environment Improvements
- Created logging wrapper scripts:
  - `.workflow/dev-with-logs.sh` - Logs dev server output
  - `.workflow/run-with-logs.sh` - Generic command logger
- Added npm scripts: `dev:logged`, `test:e2e:logged`, `logs`

### 3. Architecture Simplification
- **Removed web-tanstack frontend** (6,000+ lines)
  - Consolidated to single frontend: web-minimal
  - Updated all references in documentation and configs
- **Removed duplicate Convex codebase**
  - Deleted `/packages/convex/convex/` directory
  - Updated package to re-export from root `/convex/`
- **Enabled TypeScript checks**
  - Removed `--typecheck=disable` flag
  - Strict mode already enabled

### 4. Results
- **Code Reduction**: ~6,800 lines removed
- **Cleaner Structure**: Single source of truth for each component
- **Better DX**: Logging for debugging, TypeScript checks enabled

## Current State

### Project Structure
```
glow-wars/
├── convex/           # Single Convex backend (deployed)
├── packages/
│   ├── convex/       # Package wrapper (re-exports from root)
│   ├── web-minimal/  # Single frontend
│   ├── shared/       # Shared utilities
│   └── e2e-tests/    # E2E test suite
└── .workflow/        # Dev tools and logs
```

### What's Working
- Backend fully functional with all 10 game systems
- Frontend game creation and lobby system
- 3/25 E2E tests passing
- TypeScript checks enabled
- Logging infrastructure ready

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Run E2E tests** to verify architecture changes didn't break anything
2. **Debug "join existing game" test** timeout issue

### Short Term (Medium Priority)
1. **Simplify State Management v2**
   - Current useGameState is complex
   - Consider combining queries
   - Add proper error handling

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Create single source of truth
   - Use references instead of duplication
   - Update workflow files

### Long Term
1. Fix remaining 22 E2E tests
2. Install PixiJS for game rendering
3. Re-enable Clerk authentication

## Branch Status
- Branch: `fix/simplify-architecture`
- Commits:
  1. "fix: resolve E2E test failures and improve game state management"
  2. "refactor: simplify architecture and remove duplicates"

Ready to continue with testing and state management improvements!
