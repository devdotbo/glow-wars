# Game Lobby Test Results

## Test Environment
- Convex Backend: https://abundant-goshawk-344.convex.cloud
- Web Minimal: http://localhost:3001
- Browser: Playwright automated browser

## Issues Encountered
1. **Backend Connection**: Initial connection failed due to missing VITE_CONVEX_URL
   - **Fix**: Created .env file with Convex URL
   
2. **Function Deployment**: Convex functions not found (players:createPlayer)
   - **Cause**: Backend needs to be running first to deploy functions
   - **Fix**: Need to ensure Convex dev server is running before starting frontend

## Recommended Improvements
1. Add retry logic for guest player creation
2. Better error handling for backend connection
3. Loading states for async operations
4. Connection status indicator

## Next Steps
1. Fix backend deployment issue
2. Run full E2E test suite
3. Test edge cases (full games, disconnections)
4. Performance testing with multiple players
