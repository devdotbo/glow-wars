# Glow Wars Minimalistic Prototype Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for building Glow Wars using only PixiJS primitives - no sprites required!

## 📚 Documentation Index

### Getting Started
1. **[Overview](./overview.md)** - What is the minimalistic prototype approach and why use it
2. **[Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture.md)** - PixiJS v8 setup, game loop, and component architecture
3. **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)** - Phase-by-phase guide to building the prototype

### Building Blocks
4. **[Visual Elements Guide](./visual-elements-guide.md)** - How to create every game element with primitives
5. **[Code Cookbook](./code-cookbook.md)** - Complete, ready-to-use implementations
6. **[Visual Effects Reference](./visual-effects-reference.md)** - All effects achievable with primitives

### Development
7. **[Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md)** - Setup, tooling, debugging, and best practices
8. **[Performance Optimization](./performance-optimization.md)** - Keep your game running at 60 FPS
9. **[Convex Integration](./convex-integration.md)** - Real-time multiplayer with Convex backend

### Going Forward
10. **[Transition to Production](./transition-to-production.md)** - Moving from primitives to full production

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository>
cd glow-wars-prototype
pnpm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Convex URL

# Start development
pnpm dev
```

## 🎮 What You'll Build

A fully functional multiplayer game featuring:
- 8 simultaneous players
- Real-time territory painting
- Trail-based collision mechanics  
- 5 unique power-ups
- Stunning visual effects
- All without a single image file!

## 🏗️ Architecture at a Glance

```
PixiJS Graphics API
    ↓
Primitive Shapes (circles, lines, polygons)
    ↓
Visual Effects (glow, particles, animations)
    ↓
Game Systems (physics, collision, territory)
    ↓
Convex Backend (real-time sync)
```

## ✨ Key Benefits

- **Zero Asset Loading** - Instant startup, no waiting
- **Rapid Iteration** - Change anything with code
- **Excellent Performance** - Primitives render fast
- **Consistent Aesthetic** - Everything matches perfectly
- **Easy Testing** - No art dependencies

## 📖 Reading Order

For the best learning experience:

1. Start with the **[Overview](./overview.md)** to understand the approach
2. Read **[Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture.md)** for setup
3. Follow the **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md)** to build
4. Reference other guides as needed during development

## 🛠️ Development Tips

- Use the **[Code Cookbook](./code-cookbook.md)** for complete implementations
- Check **[Performance Optimization](./performance-optimization.md)** early and often
- Follow **[Development Workflow](./development-workflow.md)** for smooth iteration
- Plan your transition with **[Transition to Production](./transition-to-production.md)**

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

> "Feel the game, not the graphics"

The minimalistic approach forces focus on what matters:
- Responsive controls
- Satisfying gameplay
- Clear visual feedback
- Smooth performance

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **PixiJS v8** - Latest graphics engine
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout
- **Convex** - Real-time backend
- **Vite** - Fast development builds
- **React** - UI components

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| FPS | 60 stable | Smooth gameplay |
| Load Time | < 1 second | No assets to load |
| Memory | < 100MB | Efficient primitives |
| Network | < 50KB/s | Optimized updates |

## 🤝 Contributing

When contributing to the prototype:
1. Maintain the primitive-only constraint
2. Focus on gameplay over graphics
3. Test performance with 8 players
4. Document any new techniques
